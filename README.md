# Titanic Survived Prediction Project

## Project Description
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning techniques. The main goal is to understand patterns in the data and build a predictive model for survival.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as age, sex, class, and survival status.

## Key Features / Steps
- Data Loading & Exploration
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of Trends & Patterns
- Machine Learning Model Building & Prediction

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook `Titanic_Survived_Prediction_Project.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and predictions.
3. Dataset file `train.csv` is included in the repository.
